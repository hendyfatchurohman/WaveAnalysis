# ERA5 Wave Analysis

This repository provides a comprehensive Python workflow for analyzing wave dynamics using ECMWF ERA5 Reanalysis data. It is specifically designed for coastal geomorphological studies and coastal engineering.

* **Significant Wave Height (SWH or $H_s$):** Significant Wave Height is the standard measure of wave "size." It is defined as the average height (trough to crest) of the highest one-third of waves in a specific period.Physical Meaning: It closely matches what an experienced observer would estimate visually.Usage: It is the primary indicator of wave energy and potential impact on coastal structures or vessel safety.
* **Mean Wave Period (MWP):** The Mean Wave Period represents the average time interval (in seconds) between successive wave crests passing a fixed point.Physical Meaning: It indicates the "speed" or "rhythm" of the sea state.Swell vs. Wind Sea: Short periods (e.g., 4–7s) usually indicate "choppy" waves generated by local winds. Longer periods (e.g., 10–20s) indicate "swell"—waves that have traveled from distant storms and carry significant momentum.

##  Why this analysis is important
Understanding wave climate (Height, Period, and Direction) is critical for:
* **Morphodynamics:** Studying how swells shape the coastline over decades.
* **Coastal Protection:** Identifying extreme events that cause erosion.
* **Renewable Energy:** Assessing potential for wave energy converters.


## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition
1. Create an account at the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).
2. Request **"ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present"**.
3. Select parameters: 
    * `Significant height of combined wind waves and swell`
    * `Mean wave period`
    * `Mean wave direction`
4. You can customize the location by entering the coordinate and choose which year (data download is limited, so if you need a long time series, you must do it multiple times)
4. Download data in **GRIB** format.

### 2. Environment Setup
Install the necessary dependencies via terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install xarray cfgrib dask matplotlib windrose pandas
